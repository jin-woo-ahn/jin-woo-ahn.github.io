    <b>Hey, what's up!</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am a junior at 
    <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley EECS</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I come from a multicultural background:
    I was born in South Korea, spent my teenage life in China, and now am
    here in the United States.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in Software Development and Engineering,
    Machine Learning (Language and Vision), and
    Startup Businesses. I work in these areas in hopes of my work leaving
    a positive impact in our society.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have interesting topics you wish
    to discuss, feel free to reach out to me!

  <h4><b>More About Me:</b></h4>

  <div class="highlight">

    <h5><b>Research:</b></h5>
    <p>
      I do research primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
      although I am also taking a glance at Computer Vision (CV) at the moment.
      Specifically, I work on scalable oversight, supervising
      machines to perform tasks that humans alone find difficult. This way,
      I believe the problems and concerns about AI replacing humans can be
      alleviated to a certain extent while maintaining efficiency.

    <h5><b>Teaching:</b></h5>
    <p>
      I also have a passion for teaching. I usually seek to teach
      classes that I particularly enjoyed as I want students to have
      a similar or better experience in the class. Currently, I am
      a volunteer at the Microsoft TEALs program where I teach college-level
      functional programming to high school students. I am also putting together
      self-learning materials for beginners in Machine Learning during my spare time.

    <h5><b>Industry</b></h5>
    <p>
      Oftentimes, I pursue various internships on Software Engineering/Development
      and Machine Learning Research/Engineering. In the summer of 2022,
      I had a chance to work with a startup company called Dashlabs.ai (YC W21)
      as a software engineering intern.

  <h4><b>Collaboration:</b></h4>
  <p>
    Aside from the tasks that I work on above, I collaborate frequently 
    with people from different departments to work on interesting tasks that require
    computational aspects. If you are from a different department and have interesting
    projects, feel free to reach out for potential collaborative work.

      researchers at the <a href="https://www.comp-culture.org/">Computational
      Culture Lab</a> to work on topics such as computational linguistics and 
      semantic geometry spaces.
