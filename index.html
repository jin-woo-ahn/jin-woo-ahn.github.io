    <b>Hey, what's up!</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am a rising junior in the 
    <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley EECS Department</a>.
    I am also a member of the 
    <a href='http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/'>Berkeley NLP Group</a>
    and the 
    <a href='https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/'>Steinhardt Group</a>,
    which are both a part of
    <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley AI Research</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I come from a multicultural background:
    I was born in South Korea, spent my teenage life in China, and now am
    here in the United States.
    I am broadly interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and
    Startup Businesses. I work in these areas in hopes of my work leaving
    a positive impact in our society. I am always open to (1) Industry
    Internships and/or (2) Research in NLP, CV, and Robotics.

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>
      I do research primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
      Specifically, I work on scalable oversight, supervising
      machines to perform tasks that humans alone find difficult. I believe
      in the power of language not only for humans but also for machines.

    <h4>Teaching</h4>
    <p>
      I also have a passion in teaching. My usually seek to teach
      classes that I particularly enjoyed as I want students to have
      a similar or better experience in the class. Currently, I am
      teaching computer architecture at UC Berkeley and am putting together
      self-learning materials for beginners in Machine Learning

    <h4>Industry</h4>
    <p>
      Outside of school, I work primarily as a Software Engineering/Development
      or Data Science/Analyst Intern. The past summer, I had a chance to work with
      a startup company called Dashlabs.ai (YC W21) as a software engineering intern.
