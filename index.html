  <p>
    <b>Hey, what's up!</b> I am a third year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley EECS.
  </p>

  <p>
    I come from a multicultural background:
    I was born in South Korea, spent my teenage life in China, and now am
    here in the United States. Consequently, perhaps, I have a passion for
    language and believe in the power of it serving as a bridge to connect people. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I act under the following philosophy: stay disciplined instead of motivated. I believe that
    completing tasks that you are responsible for regardless of motivation
    is the definition of professionalism. One of the promises that I made myself is
    to do 50 push-ups every day, at the very least. Although this
    may seem trivial, the true intentions behind it for me is to practice being disciplined.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Furthermore, I am broadly interested in Software Development,
    Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, and
    Startup Businesses. I work in these areas in hopes of my work leaving
    a positive impact in our society.
  </p>

    <h5><b>Research:</b></h5>
    <p>
      I do research primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
      although I am also taking a glance at Computer Vision (CV) at the moment.
      Specifically, I work on scalable oversight, supervising
      machines to perform tasks that humans alone find difficult. This way,
      I believe the problems and concerns about AI replacing humans can be
      alleviated to a certain extent while maintaining efficiency.

    <h5><b>Teaching:</b></h5>
    <p>
      I also have a passion for teaching. I usually seek to teach
      classes that I particularly enjoyed as I want students to have
      a similar or better experience in the class. Currently, I am
      an instructor for the Microsoft TEALS program where I teach college-level
      functional programming to high school students. I am also putting together
      self-learning materials for beginners in Machine Learning during my spare time.

    <h5><b>Industry</b></h5>
    <p>
      Oftentimes, I pursue various internships on Software Engineering/Development
      and Machine Learning Research/Engineering. In the summer of 2022,
      I had a chance to work with a startup company called Dashlabs.ai (YC W21)
      as a software engineering intern.
